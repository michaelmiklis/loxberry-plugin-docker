# Loxberry Plugin: Docker
This Plugin installs the Docker container engine and also the portainer.io. container for graphical management.

This Plugin will integrate Docker into the LoxBerry WebUI and enables you to use Docker like any other Plugin on your LoxBerry.

## Troubleshooting and feedback
Please understand, that I cannot provide you any help with the use of the Docker engine itself. Containers are a really great technology and there are lots of guidance, videos, etc. out there.

This plugin will be improved over time and feedback is appreciated. Therefore I created a thread in the LoxForum:

# Loxberry Plugin: Docker
This Plugin installs the Docker container engine and also the portainer.io. container for graphical management.

This Plugin will integrate Docker into the LoxBerry WebUI and enables you to use Docker like any other Plugin on your LoxBerry.

## Troubleshooting and feedback
Please understand, that I cannot provide you any help with the use of the Docker engine itself. Containers are a really great technology and there are lots of guidance, videos, etc. out there.

This plugin will be improved over time and feedback is appreciated. Therefore I created a thread in the LoxForum:

## Change-Log
- 2018-08-27 Release 1.0.0 - Initial release of version 1.0.0
- 2018-11-16 Release 1.1.0 - Larger iFrame size, Portainer 1.9.1
- 2019-05-28 Release 1.1.1 - Portainer Latest (fixed the iFrame issue in the apache config)

## Known-Issues
Newer Portainer versions like 1.9.2. will not run inside an iFrame. Therefore this Plugin uses Portainer 1.9.1. Once this is fixed by portainer.io, this Plugin will be updated.
